In this project, MovieLens 1 million data is used that is publicly available. (Harper and Konstan, 2015). 
Unlike other versions of the MovieLens data, the 1 million version includes not only movie ratings but also some user demographics. 
In this dataset, there are three files: ratings, users, and movies. 
In the ratings file, there are 1,000,209 anonymous ratings of 3,706 movies made by 6,040 users. 
For each rating, user ID, movie ID, timestamp, and rating score are provided. Ratings are on a scale from 1 to 5 with 1-point increments.
